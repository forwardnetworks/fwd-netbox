# Forward Enterprise and NetBox

## Forward Enterprise
Forward Networksâ€™ flagship product, [Forward Enterprise](https://www.forwardnetworks.com/forward-enterprise/),
provides a vendor-agnostic *network digital twin* of the network.

This software platform generates a virtual replica, commonly known as a digital twin, encompassing your entire network,
including all its devices, connections, and configurations, both on-premises and in the cloud.

The platform enables you to:

* **Proactively identify and resolve issues:** By continuously analyzing the digital twin, Forward Enterprise can
    pinpoint configuration errors, security vulnerabilities, and potential problems before they cause outages or
    breaches.
* **Gain deeper network visibility:**: The digital twin provides a holistic view of your network, spanning from
    on-premises data centers to multi-cloud environments.
    This allows you to understand how everything is interconnected and how changes in one area might impact another.
* **Simplify network operations:** Forward Enterprise automates many manual tasks, such as change verification and
  troubleshooting, making it easier and faster for your IT team to manage the network.
* **Enhance security posture:** The platform helps you to identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities, track attack 
  surfaces, and validate the effectiveness of your security controls.

## NetBox

**NetBox** is a **network documentation and Infrastructure Resource Modeling (IRM)** tool designed specifically for
network engineers and operators.
It combines the functionalities of **IP Address Management (IPAM)** and **Data Center Infrastructure Management
(DCIM)** into a single platform, providing a centralized **source of truth** for your network.


Here are some key things to know about NetBox:

NetBox allows you to:

* **IP address management**: Track and manage available IP addresses, subnets, and VLANs.
* **DCIM**: Document your network infrastructure, including racks, devices, cables, power distribution, and virtual 
  machines.

## Better Together

The integration between Forward Enterprise and NetBox enables you to:
* Onbaord your NetBox instance by importing data discovered and collected by Forward Enterprise from your network
  utilizing a provided Python script.
  In this initial integration, you can export Forward devices and interfaces into your NetBox DCIM.
* Import device data such as role, tenant, and racks, not collected by Forward, from NetBox and display it in
  Forward Enterprise.

# Export data from Forward Enterprise into NetBox

## Prerequisites

1. **Create NQE queries in Forward Enterprise**: the Python script retrieves the data to be exported from Forward
   Enterprise via NQE Queries IDs. Refer to the [NQE Queries](#nqe-queries) section for more details.
2. **Configure necessary data in Netbox**: in this intial release, we assume all mandatory data required for adding
   devices and interfaces is already configured in NetBox. This include, **Sites**, **Device Types**, and **Device
   Roles**.
3. A host with Python version 3.10 or later.

## Try it out

1. Clone the GitHub repository below on a machine with Python version 3.10 and navigate to the main directory of the
   repository
   
```
$ git clone https://github.com/forwardnetworks/fwd-netbox
$ cd fwd-netbox
```
2. Set up a local properties file using the provided sample
```
$ cp fwd-ansible.properties.sample fwd-ansible.properties
```
3. Fill in the content to match your Forward and NetBox instances
> Note: Forward Entrprise does not have the concept of Device Role.
> You need to create a Device Role and add its ID the NetBox `device` section

```
---
forward:
  host: <fwd Enterprise URL>
  authentication: Basic <basic auth b64enc here>
  network_id: <Network id>
  nqe:
    devices_query_id: <NQE Query ID>
    interfaces_query_id: <NQE Query ID>

netbox:
  host: <NetBox instance URL>
  authentication: Token <auth token here>
  device:
    role: <Role ID>
```
4. Run the `export_to_netbox.py` script.
```
$ python3 export_to_netbox.py
```
5. Verify in NetBox
   Log in to your NetBox instance and verify if the devices and interfaces are sucesfully imported.
   In the screenshot below, you can find an example of importing 4 devices and their interfaces:
   ![Imported Devices](./images/netbox_imported_devices.png)
   ![Imported Interfaces](./images/netbox_imported_interfaces.png)

   If you encounter any issues, set the `debug_flag` to `True` in the Python script and run it again.

The process can be fully automated by creating a webhook in Forward Enterprise so that the export will run
every time Forward Enterprise collects data from the network, ensuring an always accurate inventory in NetBox.

# Import data from NetBox to Forward Enterprise

## Prerequisites

1. **Create NQE query in Forward Enterprise**: the Python script retrieves the data to be exported 
   from Forward Enterprise via NQE Queries IDs. Refer to the [NQE Queries](#nqe-queries) section for details.
2. **Create a NetBox Device Decorator**: Create a NetBox Device Decorator in Forward Enterprise using the NQE query
    mentioned above


## Try it out

Search for any device and verify the presence of the NetBox Devices decorator in the device card, as in the example 
below:

![NetBox Device Decorator](./images/device_decorator.png)

# NQE Queries

Below are the NQE Query to be configured in Forward Enterprise.
Both **Forward Devices** and **Forward Interfaces** queries are required for exporting data from Forward Entrprise
into NetBox, while the **NetBox Devices** query is needed for importing data from NetBox to Forward Enterprise.

Take note of the NQE query IDs; you will need them later. Refer to the [Try it out](#try-it-out) for details.
You can find the IDs by clicking on the **Info** icon
![NQE Query ID](./images/nqe_query_id.png)

> **Note:** Soon this step will not be required anymore.
> The NQE queries will be published in the Forward NQE Library and the query IDs added to the
> configuration.yaml.example file.
